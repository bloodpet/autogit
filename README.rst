Autotrack
---------

Simple script to track directory history with git.
Heavily inspired by flashbake https://github.com/commandline/flashbake,
without any bells or whistles, but recursive and track all files except
.gitignored.

Change quiet_mins value to change how many minutes to wait before auto-
commiting the changes.
